# What is Katarogu.moe?

Katarogu.moe is a free, open-source and community driven manga and anime tracking service built on top of [Katarogu](https://github.com/tygrdotdev/katarogu) to provide extra features, bug fixes, and QoL improvements.

> [!NOTE]
> Katarogu.moe is free, but also offers a paid subscription for the extra features and QoL improvements. All the money recieved from the project will go into paying for servers, supporting Katarogu core developers, and keeping the service open and free for anyone to use.
